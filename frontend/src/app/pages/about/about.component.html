      <p>
        Jamaican Heritage was born from a love of island culture and a desire to
        share it with the world. We work directly with Jamaican artisans,
        farmers, and small businesses to bring you products that are
        authentically crafted and rooted in tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every product tells a story — whether it's the careful roasting of Blue
        Mountain coffee beans, the hand-weaving of a straw basket in a rural
        community, or the generations-old jerk seasoning recipe passed down
        through families.

      <h2 class="section-title">Jamaican <span>Culture</span></h2>
      <p>
        Jamaica is more than a Caribbean island — it's a cultural powerhouse.
        From reggae music and Rastafari to dancehall, patois, and an unmatched
        culinary tradition, the island's influence spans the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to celebrate that richness by curating products that
        embody Jamaican creativity, warmth, and excellence.
